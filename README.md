###Research question 
Is there any correlation between alcohol and happniess in global scale?
The topic is important and interesting because most people in the world think when they are feeling upset they can choose to drink alcohol to solve their problem but will drinking alcohol really solve peopleâ€™s problems, and increase their happiness level?

###Conclusion
By looking at the countries that have the highest/lowest happiness and alcohol level data table, we can clearly see there is some difference in happiness between lowest alcohol consumption versus highest. It is important to realize this is not a cause and effect relation but only a correlation. To go on further, the cause for correlation might be lower alcohol consumption countries have tighter regulations which possibly can have negative affect on general happiness. If we look at the countries that have low alcohol consumption, some of the countries have war going on and have religious or government regulation on alcohol. On the other hand, Nordic countries are known for being happy and their alcohol culture, affecting the correlation greatly.
